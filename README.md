# Graph Based System for Personalized Recommendation

This project uses graph theory to model users, items, and their interactions as nodes and edges in a graph. By analyzing these relationships with graph algorithms, the system provides personalized recommendations that reflect both direct and indirect connections.

The approach enhances recommendation accuracy by considering complex user-item and item-item relationships beyond simple matching, making suggestions more relevant and context-aware.

## Features

- Graph representation of users and items
- Relationship analysis using traversal algorithms
- Personalized recommendation generation based on graph connectivity

## Technologies

- Data Structures: Graphs (Adjacency lists/matrix)
- Algorithms: Graph traversal, ranking
- Language: [Specify your programming language here]

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Follow the setup instructions for dependencies
3. Run the main program and provide input data for users and items
